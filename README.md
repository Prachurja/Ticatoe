# Ticatoe

Ticatoe is a Discord bot created using Kotlin, Gradle and JDA which allows two users to play tic-tac-toe with each other.

### Features

The one and only command of this bot is ``!tictactoe``, which you can be used to play against another person by mentioning them.
``Example: !tictactoe @Jake``

Once this command is used, both players must react with üëç to a verification message to play or üëé to not play.

Arrow reaction controls such as ‚¨Ü, ‚¨á, etc. are used to move a cursor. A move is made by reacting with the cursor's emoji. Both players must react with ü§ù if they want a draw (reaction controls inspired by [Sokobot](https://github.com/PolyMarsDev/Sokobot) by [PolyMars](https://github.com/PolyMarsDev)).

### Steps for Self Hosting

1. Install JDK 11 or higher.
2. Install the repo. 
3. Go to the Command Line (Win + R then type cmd for Windows, Command + Space then type Terminal for Mac, after that press Enter). Then type ``cd directory\where\the\repo\is\installed``
5. Enter the command - ``gradlew run`` (it takes time on the first run as it has to install some packages). You'd be prompted for your bot token, and that's it!
