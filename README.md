# Ticatoe

Ticatoe is a Discord bot created using Kotlin, Gradle and JDA (Java Discord API) which allows two users to play tic-tac-toe with each other.

---

## Bot Features

The bot joins a server with an intro from the file `Intro.txt` at `app/src/main/resources`.

The one and only command of this bot is `!tictactoe`, which can be used to play against another person by mentioning them.
`Example: !tictactoe @Jake`

Once this command is used, both players must react with üëç to a verification message to play or üëé to not play.

Arrow reaction controls such as ‚¨Ü, ‚¨á, etc. are used to move a cursor. A move is made by reacting with the cursor's emoji. Both players must react with ü§ù if they want a draw.

## Hosting

*You must create an application using the Discord Developer Portal and create a bot for the application before using any of the below options.*

### Local

*Note: Must use Java 11 or higher*

Create an environment variable named `TOKEN`, and set its value as your bot token. Use `gradlew run` to run the app. If you want to create an executable jar, use `gradlew build` instead. A jar file named `app.jar` gets stored in the `app/build/libs` directory.

*You can add `--no-daemon` after the `gradlew run` or `gradlew build` if you don't want a [Gradle daemon](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_daemon.html) running as a background process.*
