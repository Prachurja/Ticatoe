# About Ticatoe

Ticatoe is a Discord bot created using Kotlin, Maven and JDA.

The one and only command of this bot is **!tictactoe**, which you can be used to play against another person by mentioning them.
*Example: !tictactoe @Jake*

Once this command is used, both players must react with üëç to a verification message to play or üëé to not play.

Arrow reaction controls such as ‚¨Ü, ‚¨á, etc. are used to move a cursor. A move is made by reacting with the cursor's emoji. Both players must react with ü§ù if they want a draw.

Reaction controls inspired by [Sokobot](https://github.com/PolyMarsDev/Sokobot) by [PolyMars](https://github.com/PolyMarsDev).

P.S To those who don't know about Gradle, bot code is in the app/src/main/kotlin folder. Resources in the app/src/main/resources folder. The rest of the files are Gradle configuration (except README and LICENSE).
