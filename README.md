# Ticatoe

Ticatoe is a Discord bot created using Kotlin, Gradle and JDA (Java Discord API) which allows two users to play tic-tac-toe with each other.

---

## Bot Features

The bot joins a server with an intro from the file `Intro.txt` at `app/src/main/resources`.

The one and only command of this bot is `!tictactoe`, which can be used to play against another person by mentioning them.
`Example: !tictactoe @TU45I`

Once this command is used, both players must react with üëç to a verification message to play or üëé to not play.

Arrow reaction controls such as ‚¨Ü, ‚¨á, etc. are used to move a cursor. A move is made by reacting with the cursor's emoji. Both players must react with ü§ù if they want a draw.
