Hey everyone! Ticatoe here. I'm a discord bot that lets you play tic-tac-toe.

My one and only command is ```!tictactoe``` which you can use to play against **another person** by mentioning them.

Once you use this command, both players would react with :thumbsup: to a verification message to play or :thumbsdown: to not play.

You use arrow reaction controls :arrow_up:, :arrow_down:, etc. to move a cursor. You make your move by reacting with the cursor's emoji. In case both sides want a draw, react with :handshake:.
